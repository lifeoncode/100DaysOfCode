## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this repo. I'm a code newbie trying to get better at programming everyday so I thought what better way to do that than challenging myself...


## The challenge

- Learn something new or solidify a certain concept.
- Take what you learn and put it in practice (if possible).
- Share your progress with the world (tweet what you did).

## Do this everyday for 100 consecutive days



- I created a website before joining the '100DaysOfCode' challenge.
- This site will host my progress which I'll be tweeting daily.


## To follow my journey you can follow me on Twitter
